Miscellaneous shell tools for productivity.

Aiming at general purposes, but was designed by a bioinformatician in an academic setup.

- `splitjob`: convert one shell command applied on large input/output files into several parallel commands producing the same result;
- `beamsync.sh`: manage many repositories (git/rsync) of a single computer (display synchronisation status, batch synchronize);
- `seeesc`: print special characters and escape sequences with colors;
- `gitdat.sh`: several git-like functions but combining rsynced content;
- `publi.sh`: quick pandoc conversion with all relevant options;
- `printprogress_for.sh`: repeatedly run command while displaying progress.
